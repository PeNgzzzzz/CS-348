# Description
This is a database-driven application using the following frameworks.

FrontEnd: JavaScript(React) + HTML + CSS

BackEnd: Java

We plan to create an app for those who love music to recommend, search and rate music, the data is from Saurabh Shahane in Kaggle.

We have provided simple "hello world" code on both frontend (React) and backend (Java).
