CS 348 Project
FrontEnd: JavaScript(React) + HTML + CSS
BackEnd: Java
Database: MySQL

We plan to create an app for those who love music to recommend, search and rate music, the data is from Saurabh Shahane in Kaggle.

We have provided simple "hello world" code on both frontend (React) and backend (Java).

Frontend: You may find the readme file under front folder helpful to run the react component.

Backend: Now some simple code is included in back end. It connects to our local MySQL database and execute a query that displays a column from the table.
